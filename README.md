![vim-less syntax highlighting](vim.png)

Tim Pope [vim-haml](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1433) fork to highlight Less syntax correctly (mostly).

This is a very rough modification of Tim syntax files to highlight Less syntax, and despite my lack of knowledge in Vim scripting, it works quite well.
