![vim-less syntax highlighting](https://github.com/genoma/vim-less/raw/master/vim.png)

Tim Pope [vim-haml](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1433) fork to highlight Less syntax correctly (mostly).

This is a very rough modification of Tim syntax files to highlight Less syntax.

# Contributing

There are a bunch of issues right now that need attention:

- [x] `@media` queries are identified as less variables
- [x] `div { font-size: 20px; }` written on one line, is identified as `cssDeprecated` (fixed with a temporary workaround)
- [ ] The code is in need of some cleaning

If you find yourself having some free time on your hands and want to contribute, i strongly encurage you to do so.
