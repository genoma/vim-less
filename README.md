vim-less
========

Tim Pope [vim-haml](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1433) fork to highlight Less syntax correctly.

This is a very rough modification of Tim syntax file to highlight Less syntax, but despite my lack of knowledge in Vim scripting, it works better than other Less syntax files I've tested so far.
